## History

In the year 2013, I was working for a client specialized in health and fitnesst.
I had to develop a application that will show the progress of each health stage in the day.
I had an idea of how to represent each stage of task.

Later I realized that the representation of the progress was very simple and limited, so I decided to write a complete UIControl for rendering and visualization each stage of task.
