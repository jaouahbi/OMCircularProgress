## History

About 2013, I was working for a specialized client applications for health.
I had to write a method for final application will show the progress of each stage of the day healthy.
I had the idea of how to represent subtasks of tasks.

Later I realized that the representation of the progress was very simple, so I decided to write a complete control for rendering and visualization subtasks of tasks.
